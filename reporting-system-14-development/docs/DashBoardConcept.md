## Dash Board Concept

### Halqa and Jama`at Secretaries

1. Notifications from Markaz **All Un read messages** 

2. Report Comments (Any comments provided by Jama`at Secretary or National Secretary on a report should populate. This could a hyperlink/number like an email. Outstanding oneâ€™s would be highlighted

3. A graph showing the current year and which reports have been submitted and their status. 

	> 	In this I want a graph that shows J A S O N D J F M A M J (12 Jama`at year months) and shows if the secretary has entered the report or not. The colour of the line will indicate the status of the report. These colours will match with the status of the report in the report tab (draft/verified/completed/received). 

### Halqa and Jama`at GS/President

#####1. Overview

* Number of reports awaiting verification (Hyperlink that takes you to list) only for President since GS cannot verify

* Number of reports outstanding (Hyperlink that takes you to list)

* Number of reports awaiting to be received by the respective secretaries

#####2. Notifications from Markaz (in case of Jama`at) and Jama`at in case of Halqa. 

#####3. Bar graph that shows number of reports received within their respective responsibility circle by month. (This would highlight their performance).

###Secretary at the Imarat level with Halqajat as subordinates

####1. Overview

* Number of reports awaiting to be received (Hyperlink that takes you to list)

* Number of reports outstanding (Hyperlink that takes you to list)

* Their own departmental report status. 

#####2. Notifications from Markaz 

#####3. Notification for messages requesting help from their Halqajat

#####4. Bar graph that shows number of reports received within their respective responsibility circle by month. (This would highlight their performance).

###National Secretary

#####1. Bar Graphs

1. Number of reports received for respective department by month 

2. Their own reports bar graph for the current year

#####2. Number of reports that are outstanding for previous month

#####3. Notification for messages requesting help from Markaz

#####4. Messages from National General Secretary

#####5. Notification of how many Jama`ats are requesting help. And link to take them there. Essentially a preconfigured filter page showing them the reports for that month where the Secretary has asked for assistance. 


##Other Features
One other feature that I thought of was that as an option we should allow the VP of a Jama`at / Halqa to be able to verify the reports as well. If the President wishes to delegate this responsibility, the software should have this ability to allow them to do so.

(however, low priority).
