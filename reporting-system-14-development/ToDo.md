==Questions==
===Users===

- Approvals (F and U), how does it work
- Need an add user workflow
- Seems like GS can't change their profile, is it same going forward? What level of change to personal profile is allowed at user level if at all? if GS input my number wrong as a user should I be allowed to change or does it need approval from National GS (seems to be this way today) 
- Approvals and expiry of approvals, how does it work? e.g. approval for 1 year vs approval for 2 year or 6 month?
- What is election user? do we enter election information in system or not?
- I will rather move approvals / and locking of accounts to "Office Assignment" rather than user, as some users may have more than one offices and only one might be expired/locked/inactivated, not sure if we want to lock entire user account or just that office? 
- It might mean some times user will be allowed to login even when they have no office to report  / manage.
- What is the difference in "new approval" and "new user", do they need to provide both? not sure how is it linked?
- Do we want to allow Imaraat GS to "activate" "inactive" users of Halqa if Halqa GS have made the change to user profile?
- Current allows "expiration" of user as user and "office assignment" are synchronous, we will have office assignment independent from user, so user expiration will be meaning less it will be office assignments that matters, and it might be that user logs in but can't do any thing except std docs download because they don't have an office yet or that it has expired.
- Can we have more than one users assigned same office at the same time?
- Do you do approvals in advance? e.g. if we get new users starting their office in Jun of 3rd year, do we do perform all approvals in late May or do we want o have new users ready but no office in advance?



===Reports===

- Report feed back: Do we need to allow more than one user/role to provide feedback? Do we need to track comments/feedback? Like most issue trackers track comments? Current one allows indefinite editing, that make it hard to provide feed back to submitting user. I would rather allow a add comment type function where you add a comment need to add more add an other comment.
- Other than Monthly report, Tabshir and Yearly report, what type of reports do we have?
- Can GS "approve" / "verify" reports on behalf of president?
- Do we need to obtain reports from NMA?
